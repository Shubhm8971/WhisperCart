## 🚀 What We Built This Session

### 1. Deal Negotiation Engine ⭐ (Star Feature)
**File**: `backend/utils/dealNegotiationEngine.js` (293 lines)

**What it does**:
- Analyzes product prices, ratings, reviews
- Generates 5 negotiation strategies
- Creates personalized messages for sellers
- Tracks success rates
- Learns which strategies work best

**Example**:
```
User: "I want crocs under ₹2000"
App finds: Crocs @ ₹2499
Engine generates:
├─ Aggressive: "Can you do ₹1899?" (30% off)
├─ Moderate: "Is ₹2149 possible?" (14% off) ⭐ RECOMMENDED
├─ Friendly: "What's your best price?" (Highest success)
├─ Bundle: "Buy 2 for ₹4498?"
└─ Review-based: "Leverage low rating for discount"
```

**Impact**: This feature alone can drive viral growth!

### 2. API Endpoints
**File**: `backend/routes/negotiate.js` (UPDATED)

**Endpoints**:
